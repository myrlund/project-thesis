\section*{Preface}
This is a project thesis about movie recommendations, specifically answering the question: ``can movie recommendations be significantly improved by copious social media data?'' I use the term ``copious data'' to emphasize the point that I am looking at big-scale trends, public sentiment, and hype; and that I do not delve into the realm of personalized recommendations. @TODO: Extend, refine and rewrite. \\[2cm]
